Folders:
    src                  -> the main directory containing all of the source code
    src/Front_end        -> folder containing the visuals and client-side files
    src/Front_end/images -> folder containing all the images and visuals used in the displays
    src/Back_end         -> folder containing the server-side files


How to run:

Access the virtual ennviornment through:
	
	python3 -m venv venv

Then we need to activate the virtual enviornment via:

	. venv/bin/activate

Lastly we need to initialize flask to our python file through the following command:

	export FLASK_APP=__init__.py

Now we can run the program by executing:

	flask run
