CHANGES TO DESIGN:
- added a signup tab that directs to the signup page
- one signup feature that can create a User or a Band
- only ONE login page, it automatically should login based on email/password in either table

NEED TO DO:
- make signup.html, login.html, profile.html look better
- make profile.html show contents for user and/or band
	- can make a band specific page as well (this was just an idea to start)

Bugs:
- login "logs in" based on the user primary key, if I pass a band account it will log in the user with the same band key
	- fix with polymorphism: make the user the parent of either a fan/band
